# Development-of-POCT-for-Biomedical-Use-Cases
Development of Point of Care Testing Device which works on the concept of chemiluminescence. The device is prepared in such way that it calculates the intensity of light emitted out from the reaction of luminol and with the substrate. Giving us the clear graph of linearity for further study and research purposes.
